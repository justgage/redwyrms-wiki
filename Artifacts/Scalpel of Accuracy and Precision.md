## As identified by Gil:
Any surgery done by this scalpel is done with exact precision.  Dissections and surgeries do not require dexterity checks to perform.  Medical knowledge is not granted to the person using the scalpel but they will not make cut that is not intentional. The scalpel is very sharp and can easily cut though skin, muscle, flesh, tendons, ligaments, and even bone.  The scalpel is also very strong and cannot be broken without a dispel magic spell.
