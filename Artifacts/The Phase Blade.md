[[Gil]] took it from the crypt in [[Deln Eschondi Lair]].  There was a loose sheet in [[Deln Eschondi's Journal]] with a picture of the blade and multiple seemingly random notes on it, including a question of whether it was the Phase Blade

#### The Phase Blade
This long sword must be bathed in moonlight between the new moon and the full moon each cycle. It must be left in the moonlight for four consecutive hours.

n+5 long sword

- **New moon:** it can cast darkness
- **Crescent moon**: it gets +1d8 radiant damage
- **Quarter moon**: it can heal 2d8 +8 HP twice per day
- **Gibbous Moon**: it gets +1d8 force damage
- **Full moon:** it gets all of the above effects

[[Gil]] said that the blade semi-sentient, doesn't want to be bathed in moonlight.
