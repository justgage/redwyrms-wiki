Three identical spears were forged by [[Mondath]], but were likely enchanted by someone else.

## As Identified by Gil in [[Session 9 - Through the Looking Glass]]

1. The spear is a +2 spear. +3 against all creatures of the dragon type.
2. It grants the wielder damage resistance to attacks related to the main breath weapon of the dragon type it is attuned to.  For example, if the spear is attuned to a red dragon, it grants the wielder damage resistance to fire attacks.
3. The spear is a +4 weapon against dragons of the type it is attuned to.
4. Once per day, as an action, the wielder is granted the ability to shoot forth a 15-foot cone of energy from the tip of the spear.  Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  The type of energy released from the spear matches the main breath weapon of the dragon type the spear is currently attuned to.
