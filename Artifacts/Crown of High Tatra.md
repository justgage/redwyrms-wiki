Kem recovered it  from [[Deln Eschondi Lair]].  According to [[Deln Eschondi's Journal]], it originally had 3 large diamonds and 15 small diamonds.  Deln had 2 of them, which we now have in the [[Party Inventory]].

[[King Orlan Baswerk]] wore a similar crown and it was reported that he was immune to dragon breath while he was wearing it.  At that time, it did have many different colored jewels, not the diamonds.  Orlan inherited it from his Father, but there is no indication where he got it 

# Diamond locations
The original diamonds appear to be spread across Regendy for some reason.  See [[Deln Eschondi_s Journal]]

## With Diamonds
Once [[GIl]] put the 2 diamonds in, he could no longer control it.  The diamonds seem to have snapped into place (may not come out very easily). He felt that there were no dragons within a mile (or more?). It took Rufex 2 tries to remove the crown and Gil took 6 psychic damage when he was successful.
