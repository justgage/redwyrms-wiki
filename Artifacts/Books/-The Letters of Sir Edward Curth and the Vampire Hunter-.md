[[Edward Curth]] is a vampire hunter, writing to another vampire hunter named [[Calthos Wyethender]] - Calthos killed a vampire named [[Olric Eschondi]] in the city of [[Masch]] and is concerned that his sons may have the vampire desease.  Calthos discusses how he is suffering from the affliction himself and doesn't know how long he'll control it.  He wants Edward to perform the ritual on him.  Edward invites him to the Mist bay region to do the ritual in the [[Charnwood Forest]] after meeting at [[Castle Baswerk]] in 940.  Calthos responds that the ritual is 4 parts
- stab in chest with a wooden stake
- Two holy wafers in mouth (blessed by a priest of a good diety)
- cut off head
- bury him under ground
- Death marker to mark his grave

As long as the stake remains in his chest he is incapacitated
