The Legacy of the Oath of Shadows is a detailing of a man who took an oath to the [[Master of the Spider Throne]]. This master is not detailed well but he lives in a place called the [[Rotted Tower]]. This man loses his soul to the Master and eventually become undead. He watches other people who have made the same oath rise in power. He watched wizards grow in power and a warrior named Kas become one of the greatest warriors in the history of mankind. He watched Kas as he was given powers and magic items and responsibilities. The man grew jealous and began to plot against the **[[Master of the Spider Throne]]** as well as [[Lieutenant Kas]]. But they didn’t even care about his betrayal and that was a huge blow to his power and ego.

The man then made a pact with a dark fey from the [[Shadowfell]] and grew in power as his spirit whithered and passed into shadow. He haunted the area of the water falls in [[Dasir]] for centuries and some believe *he still haunts the region* though he is little more than a ghost at this point.
