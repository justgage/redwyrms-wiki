This book title reminded Naefir about his dream about [[Hextor's Hammer Crater]].

Hextor’s Hammer Crater is a location in the middle of the [[Divided Desert]]  that is a huge bowl shaped crater in the rock. Many people have studied it. It has some strange magical powers such as increasing the strength of anyone able to sleep the entire night in the crater and making raising the dead much easier if the body is placed inside the crater. People have theories about how the divided desert was once a lush green forest or plain but after a battle between the gods, all life was destroyed in the region. One person found a tiny sliver of what some believe was the hammer in the crater and it drove them mad and gave them great power. That warrior was know as [[Alaki the Mad]] and he murdered hundreds of people before he was finally killed. That was about 800 years ago and he was killed in [[Bur-Aswan]]. There is also a chapter in the book about a theory of the river that divides the desert. Some say that from [[Dasir]] to [[Bur-Aswan]] there is a great canyon that was caused by the scythe of [[Nerull]] (god of death) when he was fighting in the same battle. Others think that story is fake.
