# Naefir's Investigation
[[Naefir]] picked up the journal in [[Deln Eschondi Lair]] lair.  He had 10 minutes for an investigation check to understand what was in the journal.  He learned that it was [[Deln Eschondi]]'s journal.  It detailed his quest to assemble [[Crown of High Tatra]].  So far he had one of the gems, but he was missing the others.  He had learned that one was in [[Meberaz]] in the [[Goblin Wastes]] on the far edge of the [[Divided Desert]].  Deln spoke often of his "master" and used a special symbol when he did (I was suspicious that this was the [[Kaz Imir (the dracolich)]], but he separately refers to Kaz-Imer and asks if he is loyal to his master).  Eschondi mentioned that he avoided touching the crown because he had felt it trying to control him a number of times. 

After reading it more in depth, Naefir found that it contained a number of loosely connected ideas, some of which had no clear link to the 

# [[Crown of High Tatra]]
Deln wrote a note asking if [[King Orlan Baswerk]] knew about "Dragon Masters". How is Orlan linked with the crown? (Naefir later found KIng Orlan's crown met the description of the crown)

There are 3 large diamonds and 15 small diamonds.  Deln had 2 small diamonds from Karend and has leads for 2 of the three large diamonds.

Large diamond locations:
- [[Meberaz]] ("Confirm by the Master: One diamond in Meberaz - [[Tares]]")
- [[Bur-Aswan]] ("[[mystery master symbol]] confirms another diamond is secure in the temple there)
- ?? "Is Kaz Imir true to [[mystery master symbol]]?" #what-does-that-mean 

Little diamond locations
- [[Autour]]/[[Gragor#Gragor Bay Gordon]]?
- Kaz Imir claims to have 2
- Jeweler in [[Eveningstar]] has 2
- [[Kalendrole]] ("My 2, plus maybe 2 more")
- King of Gordon's crown ("not likely")
- [[Kreksnel]] ("Destroyed - what is left of Milonia - it will break apart")
- [[Ubayyid]] (same as Kaz Imir? - A note on the Milonia map seems to question whether this really is [[Kaz Imir (the dracolich)]] Kaz Imir's lair and says that Kaz Imir is lying to him.)
- [[Marzuq]] (note in Divided desert map indicates "Not here! (Burned? Moved? Destroyed?)" a note on the Milonia map asks "Where is Marzuq")
- [[Dasir]] (not on second list)
- "[[Karak]] might have some"



# Map of [[Gordon]]
Deln was interested in [[Gragor]]'s Bay (see link).  There are other notes about  other things:
- [[Blackwater Bay]] being a "Strange city"
- "These are not Dwarven" is written near a 3-dot symbol that seems to be connected to ruins
- "[[Vrerinthine Elves]]?"

# Divided Desert Map
Shows location of [[Hextor's Hammer Crater]] 
[[Islands off Bur-Aswan]]: "Possible Location for [[Dervin Eschondi]] / Perfect for Dervin"
[[Al-Fashir Mountains]]: "They are Gone! What has moved in? Are the Drow back?" (points at the [[mystery master symbol]])
Lower Plateau = Ar-Makkera = "Gilli Plateau???"
[[Al-Fashir Mountains]] = [[Miliper Mountains]]

# Erythnul's Morning Star / Hextors Hammer Crater
Presents interesting theory on [[Hextor's Hammer Crater]] (see link)
Notes describing [[Erythnul]].  Was Erythnul "the Mountain Shaker"? That Hextor fought "with his brother (Kadum in outlands)"? #what-does-that-mean 
Apparently Deln posessed a shard of [[Erythnul's Morning Star]] that was enchanted with "Wounding" - no healing powers will work.  Unsure how HHC/Erythnul is connected with Deln and the crown #what-does-that-mean 

# Loose Sheets
Deln had loose sheets with 
- a map of [[Tares]]'s Lair
- a map of [[Meberaz]]
	- "[[Tares]] is Dangerous - Possible Dragons" .  Who is Tares? #what-does-that-mean 
- a map of [[Eveningstar]], Capitol of [[White Coast]]
- a drawing of the "Sword of Kas  ([[The Phase Blade]]) with "random notes"
	- "Bathe in Moonlight" - What happens if you expose the sword to moonlight/moonbeam? #
	- "Vestige Remains"
	- "Binder knight"
	- [[Ka Ramad]] -> Orcs of [[Miliper Mountains]]
	- [[Aloni Talbit]] <- Points of [[Al Jamar]] <- Thieved the Blade -> Trapped Power
	- [[Gilli Plateau]]
	- kas -> p...
	- Find me! Free me!
	- Vecar(?)
	- Phase blade?

# Rumors of Lieutenant Kas
- [[Lieutenant Kas]]
- Is he the owner of the [[The Phase Blade]]? Is he still alive? #what-does-that-mean 
- "[[Hadia Kima]] is searching for something" -> [[Vestige]] <- "Where is his sword" #what-does-that-mean 
- Last seen in [[Bur-Aswan]], asking about [[Gilli Plateau]]
- [[mystery master symbol]] -> orc secrets -> moon

# Milonia Map
The notes on this map are discussed with the diamonds.
