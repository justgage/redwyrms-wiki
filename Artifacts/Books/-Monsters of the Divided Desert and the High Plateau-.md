Monsters of the [[Divided Desert]] has lots of beast mentioned. Some appear to be pure fantasy such as a four desert legged T-Rex. Others appear to be real animals or threats such as snakes, scorpions, and the [[Shazi worm]] which is know as the Aswanian Death Worm because of its venomous bite. They can get big. Like 70’ long and burrow through the sand. No one knows what they eat but supposedly they grow huge after eating the souls of their victims.

The book mentions that the worms have a resilient body that is immune to bludgeoning démange but vulnerable to slashing damage. They aren’t really creatures that love, but they live in the sandy regions of the desert. They come out at night and hunt from below. Most are only 6” to 3 feet long and eat rats and other small desert creatures. It doesn’t mention anything about them burrowing into people.
