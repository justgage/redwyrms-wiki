alias: White masked man,  Man in the White Mask

He was also was possibly seen in [[Session 3 - Travel to Swan Field (1242-04-07)]]: 
> Before they left town they checked in on Leah to make sure she was ok. She mentioned that she had a bad dream of a creature in a black cloak and **featureless white mask** with only eye holes. It was watching her from a distance in her dream but didnâ€™t do anything other than creep her out. Her dream also had a bunch of bugs and worms. Kem has strong negative connection with him, he left an Eswanian incantation for him.

Latter he appeared in [[Kem]]'s [[Verwood Forest Dreams]]. 

He has some connections with the [[Divided Desert]] and [[Shazi worm]], but [[Naefir]] can't remember the details.

[[Kem]] ([[Session 9 - Through the Looking Glass (1242-04-10)]]) skryed him with the [[Crystal Ball]] and found him in a graveyard with *low gravestones*. As he watched, the man entered the mausoleum of "[[Vincent Arcandor]]" in the [[Divided Desert]], either [[Dasir]] or [[Bur-Aswan]]. He floats and his hands are worms and bugs, probably the rest of the body. Mentally talked to Kem, "Have you come for training", Kem denied him and then said, "I'm coming for you!" as he let go of the Crystal Ball.  He has asked [[Darkus]] and [[Chaucerian]] for help stopping the [[cult of Vecna]]

[[Arcandor]], the family, has a wizard spell called ***Arcandor's wilting*** that draws all the moisture out of someone.  

As Darkus was trying to skry his mother and this man seemed to be "still on the line". See: ([[Session 9 - Through the Looking Glass (1242-04-10)]])
