Unnaturally beautiful Elvish form
Not sure of name - [[Diggs Hammerstein]] drew a picture of a dragon in [[Chanrwood]] with red-dragon sounding names: Flarina/Ember?  [[Azbara Vedos, Sage]] said that she was not to be trusted.

She was fighting the [[Kazimer (the dracolich)]] and was killed by him.

Questions for her:
- What is your name
- What do you know of Fulgrous?
- Why were you fighting him?
- Do you know where to find his Horcrux?
- What would you have us do to carry on your legacy?

What not to ask
- Would you like us to bring you back? (or anything like that)
