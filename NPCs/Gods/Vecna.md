The first and greatest of all liches. The god of secrets.

- Once was a man, became a #God
  - Only one of two people who have become a God.
  - The other is [[Saint Cuthbert]]
- Probably some relation to [[Rotted Tower]]
- Once was a king in the [[Divided Desert]]
  - 10,000 years ago
    - Lush green forests and plains
- He was a wizard / How he became a God
  - Didn't want to die
  - Moved into Lichdom
  - Moved into Demi-lichdom
  - He made [[The Phase Blade]] for [[Lieutenant Kas]]
  - Arcandor (Maybe: [[Vincent Arcandor]])
  - [[Lieutenant Kas]] cut off his left hand
    - Magic item that exists
  - Cut off his eye
    - You have to replace your eye and you get some of it's powers (not sure if he can see through yours though)
  - [[Vecna]] Killed [[Lieutenant Kas]] (but maybe he would someday come back?)
