Aliases: The Many, God of war, God of slaughter
---
God of war and slaughter, referred to as The Many because he has many forms.  He often appears as a beast/gnoll.  He is **chaotic evil**, though some of his followers are chaotic neutral.  Followers are anarchistic, always sowing seeds of destruction. ([[Session 8 .5 - Slack Regendy (1242-04-10)|ref]])

- 300' tall

Naefir saw a painting in [[Deln Eschondi Lair]], which formerly appeared to be a shrine to [[Boccob]], that depicted Erythnul fighting against the [[Father of Fire (Titan)]] with a very large army.  So apparently Erythnul has some nuance to him.

Naefir also saw him in his [[Verwood Forest Dreams]], where he was participating in a large battle of senseless violence.  He smashed the ground with his morningstar and made a crater.  This appears to be [[Hextor's Hammer Crater]], which Deln's journal confirmed.
