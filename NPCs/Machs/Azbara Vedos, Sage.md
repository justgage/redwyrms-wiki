Lives next to [[Swanfield Lake]]

Not a good fighter, very helpful and likes the group.  Has a goblin servant.  Good source for information.  [[Naefir]] is interested in coming back and spending many years there.

We told him everything about finding [[Galleon Curth]]'s body.  Huge dump of information about the world (he was good at critical rolls)

Called the [[Kazimer (the dracolich)]]  "Fulgorous"
