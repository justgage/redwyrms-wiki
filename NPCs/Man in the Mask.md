From session 3 notes: Before they left town they checked in on Leah to make sure she was ok. She mentioned that she had a bad dream of a creature in a black cloak and featureless white mask with only eye holes. It was watching her from a distance in her dream but didnâ€™t do anything other than creep her out. Her dream also had a bunch of bugs and worms. Kem has strong negative connection with him, he left an Eswanian incantation for him.

He has some connections with the [[Divided Desert]] and [[Shazi worm]], but Naefir can't remember the details.

Kem saw him enter the mausoleum of "[[Vincent Arcandor]]" in the Divided desert, either [[Dasir]] or [[Bur-Aswan]]

Arcandor, the family, has a wizard spell called Arcandor's wilting that draws all the moisture out of someone.
