        <h1>Session 10 - Reunited and It Feels so Good (1242-04-11 through 1242-04-13)</h1>
<p>#Session</p>
<h2>Dan Ferris Summary</h2>
<p>Session 10: Reunited and It Feels so Good â€“ Spring 1242 â€“ First Year of the Reign of Queen Adele (April 10-13)</p>
<p>The party discussed what should be done with the phylactery of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kaz_imir.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaz Imir</a> and came up with numerous ideas. They finally settled on <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/gil.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gil</a> using it to contact the dracolich and then blackmail him with it so he would do their bidding. Gil grabbed the lantern and spoke with Kaz Imir for a few moments (rolling an 18 for deception and a natural 20 for persuasion). He then told the party that he had told Kaz Imir that he would return <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/the_phylactery.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">the phylactery</a> after Kaz Imir did three tasks for him. The first of those tasks was to kill <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/dervin_eschondi.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dervin Eschondi</a> and leave his body at the entrance to <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/deln_eschondi_lair.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deln's crypt</a> . Once Kaz Imir had finished that task, Gil would contact him again with task number two. Kaz Imir agreed to the first task.</p>
<p>The party then left the phylactery in the cavern and went through the portal back to Delnâ€™s lair. They then used <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/gillious.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gillious</a> to open a portal to <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/azbara%E2%80%99s_tower.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azbaraâ€™s tower</a> and then took all the books through to the old sage who was thrilled to have them added to his library. Azbara was very friendly to the party again and opened up a new bookshelf in his library for the books. He also hinted that he had no heir and would be happy to take on a new sage.</p>
<p><a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/chaucerian.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaucerian</a> then used the crystal ball to look for his daughter. Instead he contacted <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/vincent_arcandor.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincent Arcandor</a> once again. Arcandor told Chaucerion that the crystal ball must be attuned to him somehow and he tried to convince Chaucerion to help him destroy the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/cult_of_vecna.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">cult of Vecna</a>.</p>
<p>Chaucerion used Gillious to open a portal to the last place he had scried on his daughter. Bob Smash, Rufex, Gil, and Darkus all went through the portal with Chaucerion to help him. They found their way into what Chaucerion recognized as a training room that he had seen in his dream. There were doors that opened into sleeping chambers for kids that were being indoctrinated and trained by the Velvet Sun. Chaucerion found his daughter amongst the 30 children who were being help against their will by the guild. She told her father that she had failed in a pickpocketing mission and had been whipped by <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/elglin.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elglin</a> for her failure. Elgin works for <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/cassidy.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cassidy</a> and they both work for Dervin. While getting ready to leave, guild members arrived to see what was going on. There were men in the next room and Darkus wildshaped into a bear to help hold the door shut with Rufex. Bob Smash held the other door to the training room while Gil and Chaucerion attempted to get the kids out through the portal made by Gillious.</p>
<p>One of the men was a wizard and cast a fireball at the door. Darkus and Rufex took considerable fire damage from the blast as it blew the door apart. Darkus, still in bear form, filled the doorway with his bulk to keep the men from getting to the kids. He got blasted by the wizard with burning hands and lost his wildshape form. He then entangled the space the men were in and restrained them. The kids were moving quickly through the portal. Bob Smash grabbed the last remaining kid and jumped through the portal. As Rufex, Darkus, and Chaucerion were about the go through the portal, the wizard was able to get another fireball spell off and blasted the group. Chaucerion was barely able to maintain concentration on holding the portal open. He had already taken the disguise of Dervin and was able to perform well enough to convince the group of men to wait for further instructions and that all this was a test.</p>
<p>They all returned to Azbaraâ€™s tower and took a long rest. The next two days were spent returning the children to their parents or getting them connected with some good sailing jobs if they did not have parents.</p>
<p>The children:</p>
<p>15 kids from Masch
7 kids from Kalendrole
3 kids from Eveningstar, Milonia
3 kids from Southeast, Gordon (including Clarity)
3 kids from Eagle Bay, Gordon
1 kid from Freeport</p>

<h2>Dan Christensen Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>We debated what to do with the Phylactery and decided that we were going to blackmail Kaz Imir and that Gil was the right person to do it.</li>
<li><a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/gil.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gil</a> was able to convince Kaz Imir that if he did 3 tasks, he would get his phylactery back, the first of which would be to drop the body of Dervin in front of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/deln_eschondi_lair.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deln Eschondi Lair</a></li>
<li>We used <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/gillious,_the_dagger.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gillious, the Dagger</a> to help us take the books to Azbara and asked him to keep them for <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/naefir.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naefir</a>
<ul>
<li>We got to Azbara's at dawn.  He was very excited to see all of the books</li>
<li>We left the lantern in the cavern</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Before going to get Clarity, <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/chaucerian.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaucerian</a> used the scrying ball to look for Clarity, they got <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/vincent_arcandor.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincent Arcandor</a> again, who said that the ball was now attuned to him.  He was interested to meet Chaucerian and tried to help him take on the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/cult_of_vecna.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">cult of Vecna</a>.</li>
<li>Naefir was suspicious that <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/deln_eschondi.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deln Eschondi</a> was part of the cult of Vecna, and asked Azbara whether the symbol in <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/deln_eschondi_s_journal.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deln Eschondi_s Journal</a> could be associated with Vecna.  Azbara produced a book with that same symbol scrawled on it, representing Vecna.</li>
<li>5 of the party (everyone but Kem, Thorontor, and Naefir) went with Chaucerion to the room where he last saw Clarity.</li>
<li>As he was checking out the premise, he went into rooms where children were sleeping, recognizing on the way the training room, adjacent to which where all of the childrens' rooms.
<ul>
<li>They found Clarity in the room with the youngest children</li>
<li>She said that she was whipped by Elglin, who works for Cassidy, who works for Dervin</li>
<li>The party members in the hall heard someone coming and braced the door.</li>
<li>The party worked together to stall the adults and rushed all of the children through the portal.</li>
<li>Chaucerian only barely managed to keep the portal open.  He diguised himself as Dervin and was able to convince the men who rushed into the room at the end to wait for further instructions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Of the orphans
<ul>
<li>15 are from Machs (2 orphans, one is the oldest and was about to be iniated)</li>
<li>7 Kalendrole</li>
<li>3 Evening Star (all orphans, but know someone there)</li>
<li>3 are from SE Gordon</li>
<li>3 are from Eagle Bay Gordon</li>
<li>1 is from Freeport (orphan)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We took a long rest in Azbara's hut</li>
<li>We spent a couple days getting all of the kids back to their homes.  The orphans were set up with the maritime guild as ships' boys (meaning we didn't need to visit Evening Star and Freeport).  We made sure that the oldest, who seemed eager to get back to the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/velvet_sun.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Velvet Sun</a> was not dropped off in Maschs and was on a long voyage.</li>
<li>As they were in Kalendrole, Naefir found a library and picked up some books about Kalendrole history, including one about the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/-the_dragonborn_scourge_of_kalendrole-.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">-The Dragonborn Scourge of Kalendrole-</a>
<ul>
<li>Several of the people that went about during the Dragon Born Scourge of Kalendrole were from the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/velvet_sun.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Velvet Sun</a></li>
</ul>
