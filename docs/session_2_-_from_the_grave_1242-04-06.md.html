        <h1>Session 2 - From the Grave (1242-04-06)</h1>
<p>Session 2: From the Grave â€“ Spring 1242 â€“ First Year of the Reign of Queen Adele&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thorontor, Gil, Kem, Chaucerion, and Darkus had just finished searching the bodies of the fallen when the ground around numerous of the graves started to tremble. At the same time two people had seen the commotion at the cemetery and were moving in to investigate. Naefir (a firbolg) and Bob Smash (a purple dragonborn) both approached the cemetery and saw the ground shaking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In several places the ground erupted from below and skeletal zombies crawled out of the graves to attack anything in sight. They lumbered towards the party attacking with claws and teeth. Naefir joined the battle by moving a large pile of dirt onto one of the graves that was shaking to keep anything below from coming up. Bob Smash joined the party by charging in to help with his axe.</p>
<p>The battle was on and the undead beasts kept coming up fro the ground. The adventurers fought with every spell and weapon that they had. Suddenly, the door to the mausoleum burst open and a skeleton wearing an old ceremonial breast plate and carrying a long sword moved down the stairs. Bob Smash knew this tob to be of the family of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/callus_silvertounge.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Callus Silvertounge</a> who had died more than 100 years ago. Other skeletons followed that first one out of the mausoleum, some moving faster than others. Several also had their entire chest cavities filled with crawling bugs and worms.</p>
<p>The battle raged on and at one point Kem dropped to the ground unconscious. A nearby undead was about to feast on his unmoving form when it met a grisly end from the axe of Bob Smash. The last of the undead were finally defeated and Kem was revived with magical healing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The heroes could still see the ground shaking under the piles of dirt that Naefir had placed on the graves but the shaking was dying down and eventually came to a stop. Naefir objected to looting the mausoleum and the party decided to head back to <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/the_chisel.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Chisel</a>.</p>
<p>At the Chisel, the party met back up with <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/durin_mccormick.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Durin McCormick</a>, a dwarf dressed in fancy clothes and a large hat wide-brimmed hat with a colorful feather who had been the companion of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/diggs_hammerstein.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diggs Hammerstein</a>. They told Durin what had happened to his friends and he filled sadly them in on what Diggs and the others had been working on. He told them of the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kaz_imir.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaz Imir</a> named Kaz-Imir that they had been hunting. He mentioned that the dragon originally came from the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/divided_desert.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Divided Desert</a> and had the power to shoot lightning. He told the group about the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/shazi_worm.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shazi worm</a> Shazi worms that had the power to invade your brain and control your actions eventually devouring your brain and taking its place. He told them about Sir <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/galleon_curth.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galleon Curth</a> and ancient dragon battles in the region of Mist Bay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The party returned reluctantly to the cemetery even though they were mostly out of spells and badly injured. They destroyed a <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/shazi_worm.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shazi worm</a> that they discovered in a grave and they followed some tracks of what appeared to be a zombie leaving the cemetery. They followed the tracks through town and heard a woman scream. They found a young lady naed Leah who was being attacked by the zombie and Bob Smash cut it down and squeezed a Shazi worm to death taking some poison damage on his hand.</p>
