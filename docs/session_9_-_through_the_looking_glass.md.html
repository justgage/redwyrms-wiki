        <p><em>Session 9: Through the Looking Glass ‚Äì Spring 1242 ‚Äì First Year of the Reign of Queen Adele</em></p>
<p>Many things were discovered through trial and error and exploration.</p>
<p>They cast <strong>Speak with Dead</strong> on the body of the Red Dragon elf lady (see <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/flarina,_the_female_red_dragon.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flarina, the female red dragon</a>) and found that <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kaz_imir.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaz Imir</a> was after the jewels in her treasure hoard.</p>
<p><a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/gil.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gil</a> placed the two diamonds into the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/crown_of_high_tatra.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crown of High Tatra</a> and put on the crown and lost control of himself for a time.</p>
<p>The party identified <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/wyrmsbane.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wyrmsbane</a> and <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/rufex.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rufex</a> fastened it to the end of his javelin.</p>
<p>The party suspects that <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/the_phase_blade.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Phase Blade</a> is a vestige of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/lieutenant_kas.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lieutenant Kas</a> and was once his sword.</p>
<p>The secret door north out of the laboratory was found to lead to an underground stream and a secret entrance in the side of the rock cliffs.</p>
<p><a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/chaucerian.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaucerian</a> used the crystal ball to look for his daughter, <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/clarity.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarity</a>. He was able to see her. She was in an alley in what looked like a large desert city. She traveled through the streets for a bit and ended up in a dark room with a few other kids. She was on a pickpocketing mission and did not succeed.</p>
<p>The ball was also used by <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kem.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kem</a> to look for the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/man_in_the_white_mask.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Man in the White Mask</a>. They discovered that he was completely made up of worms and bugs. He could see him cross a large bridge over a wide river and make his way into a mausoleum with the name <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/vincent_arcandor.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincent Arcandor</a> (written in Aswanian) over the door. He made an offer to Kem but Kem instead told him, ‚ÄúI am coming for you!‚Äù</p>
<p><a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/darkus.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darkus</a> used the crystal ball to seek out his mother, but the scry spell did not work. Then the masked man interrupted the spell and made an offer to Darkus. He wanted help dealing with a <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/cult_of_vecna.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">cult of Vecna</a> and would help Darkus find his family.</p>
<p>The party read a book about Vecna. (<a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/the_hand_and_the_eye,_vecna.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hand and the Eye, Vecna</a>)</p>
<p>Then they went through the one-way portal into what they were told was the ruins of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/castle_baswerk.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Castle Baswerk</a>. They arrived in a prison dungeon and there was an undead thrall in one of the cells. The killed it and decomposed it. Kem also noticed the spirit of a girl but she avoided the party. Gil misty stepped on the other side of the locked door and let the party out. Then he proceeded down the hall and almost got hit by a blade trap and then was attacked by a kobold in the wall shooting a crossbow.</p>
<p>He got through the door and entered a room with four statues of old kings. They killed two kobolds and noticed the kings were all wearing the crown of high tatra.</p>
<p>They left the statue room and ended up in an intersection of hallways with awesome levers on the wall and tiles on the floor. The levers needed to be pulled in some order and the party figured it out through trial and error and mage hand setting off numerous traps along the way. Once they were pulled in the proper order, the center tile started to descend into the ground. It went into a large cavern with a chest on the ground and a lantern hanging on a hook. The chest was a mimic which they fought and killed and after casting identify, they found out the lantern was the phylactery of the Dracolich, Kaz Imir who now somehow knows they have it in their possession.</p>
<p><a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/wyrmsbane.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wyrmsbane</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once per day the spear can be attuned to a certain type of chromatic dragon.&nbsp; It retains that attunement until it is attuned to a different type of dragon.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The spear is a +2 spear. +3 against all creatures of the dragon type.</li>
<li>It grants the wielder damage resistance to attacks related to the main breath weapon of the dragon type it is attuned to.&nbsp; For example, if the spear is attuned to a red dragon, it grants the wielder damage resistance to fire attacks.</li>
<li>The spear is a +4 weapon against dragons of the type it is attuned to.</li>
<li>Once per day, as an action, the wielder is granted the ability to shoot forth a 15-foot cone of energy from the tip of the spear.&nbsp; Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.&nbsp; The type of energy released from the spear matches the main breath weapon of the dragon type the spear is currently attuned to.</li>
