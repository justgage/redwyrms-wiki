        <h1>Session 4 - Dragon Bones (1242-04-08)</h1>
<p>Session 4: Dragon Bones â€“ Spring 1242 â€“ First Year of the Reign of Queen Adele&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, Gil and Naefir both woke up to notice that someone was attempting to steal from Kemâ€™s bag. Gil put his dagger to the thiefâ€™s neck and the thief claimed to be looking for his gold bracelet that someone stole. The guards were called and they arrested the thief who had a tattoo below his neck on his back of a sun symbol. The party later discovered it was the symbol of the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/velvet_sun.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Velvet Sun</a> thievesâ€™ guild.</p>
<p>Kem had a fever at this point and was sweating pretty bad. Naefir detected poisons and disease on him and found out he had an infection in the wound from the ghoul bite but it seemed like he would recover in time.</p>
<p>In the morning, the party left Kem in the inn common room and went downstairs to meet Matrick Wallace <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/matrick_wallace.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matrick Wallace</a>.&nbsp; They decided to have Matrick take them to see the sage tower instead of going to the dragon bone site. They left town with Matrick. At the inn, the innkeeper gave Rufex the dwarf 5 gold pieces to follow after his son and make sure the party was not going to cause any trouble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sage tower was small â€“ only ten feet across and two stories tall. It appeared to be in poor condition. They knocked and a goblin wearing a vest and breeches answered the door and asked them what they wanted. They were let in to see the sage who was an only human about 85 years old who like to use mage hand to make tea and summon books to himself. His name was Azbara <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/azbara_vedos,_sage.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azbara Vedos, Sage</a> and he was full of information.</p>
<p>He told them a lot of information about <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/galleon_curth.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galleon Curth</a>, the Silver Dragonborn Paladin of Pelor, who had died in this region after helping <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/king_orlan_baswerk.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Orlan Baswerk</a> defeat three blue dragons in the Mist Bay area. No one knows where exactly he died or how it happened but it was assumed he was killed by a dragon.</p>
<p>They heard noise outside where they had left Matrick and a skeletal lake serpent was in the water near the boy and it was being fought by a rather tall dwarf with a halberd. The party joined the battle and defeated the lake beast with the help of Azbara. It was assumed that when the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kaz_imir.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaz Imir</a> flew over the lake, its necrotic powers had given life to the skeleton of the ancient beast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The party also discovered that two skeletons from the graveyard in <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/swan_field.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swan Field</a> had risen from the grave and were put down by the guard in town.</p>
<p>The party then traveled with Matrick to the vernal pond where he had been discovering the dragon bones each fall.&nbsp; The site was underwater but the party began investigating and found a few bones. While in the water, a Elemental Water Weird attacked Matrick and tried to drag him into the water. Darkus used levitation to keep Matrick from going under and the party defeated the elemental with a combination of ice magic and brute force, finally killing it with some mean insults.</p>
<p>They dug for the bones and found a dragon skeleton. In the side of the dragon skeleton the found the tip of a spear, the fabled Wyrmsbane. They also discovered a body inside the dragonâ€™s belly. It was a dragonborn skeleton carrying a few objects:</p>
<p>A nice magical dagger</p>
<p>A scroll case containing two magical scrolls and a letter from King Baswerk to Sir Gallioon Curth</p>
<p>A symbol of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/pelor.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelor</a> with the letters SW etched in the back.</p>
<p>Naefir decomposed the body of the knight and they left the dragon bones for Matrick as promised.</p>
