<p>Naefir decides to use Guidance and his Find Memory ability as he's looking at the mural to figure out who the iron giant is. He rolls a 9 (which his ability turns into a 10) and a 4 with a +5 to history for a total of 19... ^7eb9b5</p>

<p>The mural is beautifully painted and very old. On the left side of the wall, the giant figure is definitely <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/erythnul.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erythnul</a> the god of slaughter also known as <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/the_many.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Many</a>.&nbsp; He is in the form you have always seen him in - a beast and he is wielding his morning star.</p>

<p>On the right side of the mural, facing all of the armies of fiends, angels, and men is a huge iron giant. It looks kind of like a golem or something similar. It is the only other creature in the painting that is as big as <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/erythnul.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erythnul</a>, and comparing it to the size of the people below, it would stand about 300' tall.&nbsp; Naefir has some memories about such a creature but they are limited. He believes this might be one of the fabled <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/titans_of_chaos.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Titans of Chaos</a> who fought against the deities in an ancient battle. The Titans of Chaos were rumored to predate the deities but little is known of them. The name that comes to mind for this one is Father of Fire. You believe that you have seen another name for him, but you can't recall it at this time.</p>

<p>Naefir also notices that there are several bodies on the ground in the mural. One is a young handsome warrior in golden platemail with a yellow cloak that is stained with blood. <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/erythnul.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erythnul</a> is standing over his body. That warrior is wearing the symbol of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/pelor.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelor</a> engraved on his breastplate. It is not easy to make out at first because the details are pretty small but it is definitely there. The man is holding a dagger in each hand. Another young warrior is badly injured and he is stooping to take the daggers out of the dead warriors hands. He too is wearing a yellow cloak and though he looks young, there is a lot of pain and suffering drawn on his face. Another body lies on the ground near <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/etrythnul.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Etrythnul</a>. It is an older wizard with long gray hair wearing purple robes covered in golden runes. His eyes are fixed on Erythnul and though he in prone on the ground his left hand is slightly raised as if he is casting a spell on Erythnul. The look on his face does not appear to be aggressive towards Erythnul. Naefir could stare that this painting for days.</p>

<p>So in Naefir's dream it sounded like a war of good races vs evil races (humans etc vs orcs etc and metallic vs chromatic dragons). Is that the way it is depicted in the mural? Is the Father of Fire fighting for the human/elf/dwarf side?</p>
<p>Nevermind. I just reread a little more carefully. Everyone (good and evil) is fighting the titan. For some reason, <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/erythnul.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erythnul</a>, <strong>a chaotic god of slaughter</strong> is fighting against them, particularly some followers of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/pelor.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelor</a>, from behind. So this is probably a different battle scene than Naefir's dream. Apparently Erythnul wasn't very keen on fighting against the titan or just got carried away.&nbsp;(edited)</p>

<p>Naefir certainly could look at this painting for days, and he just might. Does Naefir recognize the location of the battle?&nbsp; He's also trying to figure out what this place is. <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/deln_eschondi_lair.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deln's Lair</a> seems to be some kind of repurposed shrine - the beautifully ornate entry door being one thing that seemed out of place in a villain's lair. Are there any other signs of whether this was a religious shrine for Pelor or Erythnul?</p>

<p>I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;think I was very clear in all my descriptions.&nbsp;Everyone, including Erythnul, seems to be fighting the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/erythnul.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Titan</a>.&nbsp; <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/erythnul.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erythnul</a> is standing near some fallen allies and appears to be raging in anger as he stares at the Titan.&nbsp;Forces of good and evil are fighting side by side to try to destroy the Titan but his iron form appears to be very tough to damage .Definitely a different battle than Naefir’s dream.&nbsp;There are so many warriors and bodies below them that the ground is not discernable as the painter&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;choose to focus on that at all.&nbsp;It appears there are a couple spires of stone in the distance.Deln’s lair does seem to be repurposed.&nbsp;He didn’t&nbsp;seem to care about this painting or the one in his laboratory.&nbsp;This room seems to be a sort of gathering room based on its size but the entire&nbsp;dungeon isn’t&nbsp;really big enough to serve a large number of people.</p>
<p><a href="https://homeschool-dads.slack.com/archives/C04A3PEQY6S/p1668191685442559" rel="noopener noreferrer">11:34</a></p>
<p>It&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;seem to be a shrine of Pelor and definitely not Erythnul.&nbsp;Roll a religion check for me when you get a chance.</p>

<p>Got it.&nbsp; Apparently I was trying too hard to reconcile your descriptions with the dream. That makes more sense.So the room seems like more of a ancient conference room. Interesting. So for a religion check I rolled 11 with a guidance roll of 4, so the total is 18 since I'm not proficient in religion.</p>

<p>You would guess that this wass possibly a shrine to <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/boccob.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boccob</a>, the god of knowledge and magic. It might also be him or a servant of his that is wearing the purple robes in the painting. This room could have been a study room for any who visited while the bedroom would have been for the shrine keeper and the laboratory would have been a small library.&nbsp;His&nbsp;holy symbol is an eye balanced on a pedestal which in a way could be the pillar and round ball on top of it in the “welcome” room. ^3626fc</p>

<p>Ahh. Cool. I was going to ask about the man in the robes. Now it all makes sense. <strong>So Deln was able to reprogram the security system</strong>. By the way, did any of the books in the library seem as old as the original shrine or did they look like Deln's personal collection? I know some of them cover the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/baswerk.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baswerk</a> era, so maybe not those unless Deln more recently moved into this lair.</p>

<p>The books definitely seem to be Deln's Personal Collection. However, it could be some of the books were ones he found here when he made this place his lair. A few that seem extremely old:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Age of Light: A Study of Darkness Within"</li>
<li>"<a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/the_hand_and_the_eye,_vecna.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hand and the Eye, Vecna</a>"</li>

<p>Meanwhile kem is very happily taking the spider dragon parts. Some of his alchemical training taught him some value of things, but he takes some extra time to figure out how the breath weapon functions. His interest is partially pure knowledge for knowledge sake, but he also catches himself looking for any weak points were he to fight another.</p>

<p>Her fangs are razor sharp and they are made for slashing. The poison bite mechanism is designed to spritzer venom into the wounds once the jaw opens back up after a bite. There are millions of tiny eggs inside her belly along with millions of tiny spiders. They crawl into a waiting area in her neck where she can feed them. You would guess there are enough tiny spiders to use her breath weapon about a dozen times.</p>
<p><a href="https://homeschool-dads.slack.com/archives/C04A3PEQY6S/p1668209520717069" rel="noopener noreferrer">4:32</a></p>
<p>There is also a strange hot gizzard like organ in her chest.&nbsp;It almost looks as if it could ignite and burst into flames causing fire to wash over the tiny spiders in the waiting area.</p>

<p>Kem partly evaluates for 'How could I plug up the breath weapon in a fight?'</p>
<p><a href="https://homeschool-dads.slack.com/archives/C04A3PEQY6S/p1668209661564099" rel="noopener noreferrer">4:34</a></p>
<p>Kem very excitedly considers if he can extract that gizzard with its internal contents.</p>

<p>The neck is the choke point.&nbsp;You are not sure what type of force she would be able to exert but the tiny spiders came out pretty fast.</p>

<p>The gizzard is about 150 degrees F. It doesn’t burn you to touch it but it is hot. The skin around it is toughened and hard to cut.</p>

<p>Question about tool proficiency rolls: is that straight proficiency bonus or does it use an ability (ie alchemy being Intelligence most likely)?</p>

<p>Yes.&nbsp;This would be an intelligence check plus your proficiency bonus to use your alchemy knowledge.</p>

<p>You have no problems cutting the gizzard free.&nbsp;It is strange.&nbsp;It is shiny and hot.&nbsp;Even when pulled away from the beast, it stays warm.&nbsp;It is not at all squishy and it reflects the light in odd ways.&nbsp;Sometimes absorbing it and other time reflecting it depending on how you look at it.&nbsp;It is a out the size of a slightly flattened grapefruit.</p>

<p>No large openings.&nbsp;The texture is somewhat like a leathery scale but the scales seem to adjust slightly and the heat is coming out from those tiny vents.&nbsp;It does not create light but those scales reflect it and the tiny vents seem to absorb it.</p>

<p>Also, kem realizes that when looking at the spider dragon and evaluating it for weak points, he was approaching it like an adventurer and not as an alchemist. He is somewhat disturbed by this realization that that came so secondhand to him now....</p>

<p>Wow!

<p>"That's a handy little trick. I guess I can take a break from studying this mural. The artist had incredible brushwork and this part of history is new to me, but I'm getting weary of these little guys climbing up my legs whenever I stand still. At least they've stopped biting. Now that I understand where we are, though, I would like to look at the mural in the library and review the titles again. Better yet, let's take a break in the library. We have a lot to study and figure out. I have a feeling we're getting ourselves involved in something big and dangerous and the more we know, the better we'll handle it."</p>

<p>As he walks to the library Naefir is lost in thought trying to piece together some of the random notes in the journal. Most prominent is a connection that Deln alludes to between <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/king_orlan_baswerk.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Orlan Baswerk</a>, <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/crown_of_high_tatra.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Tatra</a>, and <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/dragon_masters.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Masters</a>. Naefir's Find Memory ability lasts for an hour. If you say Naefir was studying the mural for more than an hour, he'll use a spell slot to keep up Find Memory (your call) - Naefir is trying to remember everything he knows about <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/orlan's_crown.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orlan's crown</a>. Once in the library, Naefir is going to start by studying "<a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/-castle_baswerk_and_the_tales_of_king_orlan_baswerk-.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">-Castle Baswerk and the Tales of King Orlan Baswerk-</a>" with the same objective and to review the basic story of King Orlan and find any other important details that are only found in this book.For a History check he gets an 18 with 2 for guidance (Nat 20?) +5 (25)For investigating the book, he rolls a 10 (thanks to Find Memory, otherwise it would have been a 5) with 1 for guidance and and his +3 (14).</p>

<p><a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/castle_baswerk.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Castle Baswerk</a> was constructed during the Reign of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/king_albon_baswerk.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albon Baswerk</a> when <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/king_orlan_baswerk.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orlan</a> was only a boy. Young Orlan loved the castle construction site and spent much of his youth learning various trades from the masters who were building his father's castle. When Orlan was just a ld, his best friend was a young silver dragonborn named <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/galleon_curth.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galleon Curth</a>. The two were very close and spent every day together. Much of the book is stories of Orlan and Galleon getting into trouble as kids. Hunting in the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/charnwood_mountians.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charnwood Mountians</a>,.. excursions into the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/yewborn_forest.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yewborn Forest</a>... ghost hunting near edge of the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kingsfire_barrens.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kingsfire Barrens</a>... mountain climbing up to the top of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/regal_peak.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regal Peak</a>. The once Orlan was crowned as King of the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/mellow_sea.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mellow Sea</a>, the two fought off goblin invaders from the Upper Verwood and they protected the region from pirates in Mist Bay.</p>

<p>The book goes on to talk about the early dragon battles and how one particular battle occurred during a tournament at Castle Bawerk. Orlan happened to be wearing his crown (the description fits the Crown of High Tatra except the gem stones in the crown were all different colors) and when he was wearing the crown he was immune to the breath of the dragons who attacked. From that time forward he always wore the crown into battle against the dragons and he rarely ever took it off except to sleep. The book has nothing but glowing praise of Galleon and his bravery. It talks of him using the ancient Wyrmsbane Spear to defeat the dragons and how he was never afraid to face them in battle.</p>

<p>The book only briefly mentions Deln Eschondi as the King's Wizard. It talks about how Deln was constantly creating potions of flying so the knights could take to the air against the dragons when they attacked. It also mentions how Deln tok a lot of interest in everything magical, especially the Crown.</p>

<p>Intriguing. So Naefir could read here all day, the question is how much time the rest of the party will give him, though building terrariums can take time (and how long until someone comes to do a wellness check on poor old Deln). But I hope you'll be generous with how fast a reader he is (and how much you want to type out - I've got a lot of questions, a fair amount of time before our next session, and access to a pretty good library&nbsp;<img src="https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f601@2x.png" alt=":grin:">). The next book he would pull out is The History of the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/-the_history_of_the_kings_and_queens_of_masch-.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">-The History of the Kings and Queens of Masch-</a> to research the historical context of the Baswerk dynasty and the extent of his rule.

<p>It starts with the tribal kings of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/masch.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Masch</a> 1100 years ago. These were the first people to live in Masch according to the book. They mostly came west from the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/divided_desert.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Divided Desert</a> but some also came south from <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/gordon.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gordon</a>. These in fact were not the first. There were communities of elves and other fey related races that lived in the area when the humans arrived but they retreated further back into the wilderness to avoid the human culture.The tribes of humans made settlements all along the coast and even went further south into what is now <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kalendrole.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalendrole</a>. They would raid each other’s tribal coastal towns and war was very common.Eventually, tribes grouped together through marriage or treaty and the tribal kings became Regional Kings. They had several towns and cities under them and ruled larger geographic areas. Masch became the most populous city in the area and the King of Masch ruled over the largest area but&nbsp;he didn’t&nbsp;rule the entire country.&nbsp;Orlan was a regional king of an area known as the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/mellow_sea.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mellow Sea</a>.&nbsp;That area battled with the area known as the Kingsfire Barrens quite a bit and those wars continued up until about 150 years ago when all of Masch was united under a single monarch.&nbsp;There have been 7 kings since that time.&nbsp;Queen Adele is not mentioned in the book and neither was her brother King Archman who was king for 12 years before she took the throne when he died.</p>

<p>The Legacy of the Oath of Shadows is a detailing of a man who took an oath to the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/master_of_the_spider_throne.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Master of the Spider Throne</a>. This master is not detailed well but he lives in a place called the Rotted Tower. This man loses his soul to the Master and eventually become undead. He watches other people who have made the same oath rise in power.&nbsp;He watched wizards grow in power and a warrior named Kas become one of the greatest warriors in the history of mankind.&nbsp;He watched Kas as he was given powers and magic items and responsibilities.&nbsp;The man grew jealous and began to plot against the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/master_of_the_spider_throne.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Master of the Spider Throne</a> as well as Lt Kas.&nbsp;But they&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;even care about his betrayal and that was a huge blow to his power and ego.The man then made a pact with a dark fey from the Shadowfell and grew in power as his spirit whithered and passed into shadow.&nbsp;He haunted the area of the water falls in Dasir for centuries and some believe he still haunts the region though he is little more than a ghost at this point.</p>

<p>Monsters of the Divided Desert has lots of beast mentioned.&nbsp;Some appear to be pure fantasy such as a four desert legged T-Rex.&nbsp;Others appear to be real animals or threats such as snakes, scorpions, and the Shazi worm which is know as the Aswanian Death Worm because of its venomous bite.&nbsp;They can get big.&nbsp;Like 70’ long and burrow through the sand.&nbsp;No one knows what they eat but supposedly they grow huge after eating the souls of their victims.</p>

<p>Does the monster of the divided desert mention how to detect the worms, where they love, their weaknesses?</p>

<p>Also I become very drawn to the painting in the library and look at its many details.</p>

<p>The book mentions that the worms have a resilient body that is immune to bludgeoning démange but vulnerable to slashing damage.&nbsp;They&nbsp;aren’t&nbsp;really creatures that love, but they live in the sandy regions of the desert.&nbsp;They come out at night and hunt from below.&nbsp;Most are only 6” to 3 feet long and eat rats and other small desert creatures.&nbsp;It&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;mention anything about them burrowing into people.</p>

<p>The mural is a strange painting. The warrior is definitely struggling but not going dur without taking as many fiends and undead with him as possible. There are many dead monsters on the ground around the warrior. The warrior has a glorious great sword that seems to glow a bit. The location seems to be some hellish plane with fire and molten rock dotting the landscape. In the distance there are pillars of stone and a tower of dark stone. As shown in this picture. Details are not easy to pick out as the painting is pretty old.&nbsp;You do also notice that it appears much of the ground is also covered in either fog or smoke or ash.&nbsp;It could just be the painter’s style but it is definitely intentional.</p>

<p>Wow, caught up!<br>
So, since I am the only one immune to the spiders poison, I am wondering how is the party acting? Are they a bit more lethargic, drunk, silly. Is Naefir looking at the murals for a long time due to the psychedelic affects?<br>
Has Kem vomited due to poison?<br>
Has any one passed out, while building terrarium?<br>
Rufex goes and cleans him self up. He looks around till he finds some water and some cloth and talks a quick sponge bath? Also taking care to clean his kit.<br>
After he sees Naefir stumble through the halls to the library. Seeing he is the only one who has left the death chamber he goes to be his guard. Realizing he is coherent but his language is impaired. He looks over Naefir’s&nbsp; shoulder to see what he is talking about. When Kem comes in it is apparent that their drunken stupor they have not realized That Rufex have joined them. They Bable back and forth. Bored Rufex looks for books about mining, weapon/ jewelry etc making. Or even monster evil critter books in the areas we are looking to go to.&nbsp;(edited)</p>

<p>Kem was a little bit slow and nauseous for sure, in part because the dissection is kind of gross. You can only handle so much of that...</p>

<p>"Hey <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/rufex.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rufex</a>, there's a couple books here you might find interesting: The Arts and Sciences of a Dwarven Anvil and Swage, The Classes of Metallurgy, or Historical Landmarks of Gordon"</p>

<p>Naefir is tempted by the very old books Dan mentioned earlier, but he digs into Hector's Hammer Crater and the Blow that Shook the World to see how well it squares with his dream and to get a better historical context, before and after, for why that event is significant. For Investigation I rolled a 16 with a guidance roll of 3 for a total of 22.</p>

<p>Rufex finds that the book on the Dwarven Anvil and Swage is really quite amusing as it describes dwarven weaponsmithing from the perspective of a human blacksmith who has no idea how to work metal or obviously do anything with skill.&nbsp;His observations of dwarven technique are crude and overly eloquent at the same time.&nbsp;He talks like weaponsmithing is an art form instead of a calling.&nbsp;He has no idea of the passion and dedication it takes to master the anvil and pretty much embarrasses himself the entire book.&nbsp;It is good for laughs but not much else.</p>

<p>Hextor’s Hammer Crater is a location in the middle of the divided desert that is a huge bowl shaped crater in the rock.&nbsp;Many people have studied it.&nbsp;It has some strange magical powers such as increasing the strength of anyone able to sleep the entire night in the crater and making raising the dead much easier if the body is placed inside the crater.&nbsp;People have theories about how the divided desert was once a lush green forest or plain but after a battle between the gods, all life was destroyed in the region.&nbsp;One person found a tiny sliver of what some believe was the hammer in the crater and it drove them mad and gave them great power.&nbsp;That warrior was know as Alaki the Mad and he murdered hundreds of people before he was finally killed.&nbsp;That was about 800 years ago and he was killed in Bur Aswan.&nbsp;There is also a chapter in the book about a theory of the river that divides the desert.&nbsp;Some say that from Dasir to Bur Aswan there is a great canyon that was caused by the scythe of Nerull (god of death) when he was fighting in the same battle.&nbsp;Others think that story is fake.</p>
