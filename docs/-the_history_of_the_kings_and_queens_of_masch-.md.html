        <h1>-The History of the Kings and Queens of Masch-</h1>
<p>It starts with the tribal kings of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/maschs_country.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maschs (country)</a> 1100 years ago. These were the first people to live in Masch according to the book. They mostly came west from the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/divided_desert.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Divided Desert</a> but some also came south from <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/gordon.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gordon</a>. These in fact were not the first. There were communities of elves and other fey related races that lived in the area when the humans arrived but they retreated further back into the wilderness to avoid the human culture.</p>
<p>The tribes of humans made settlements all along the coast and even went further south into what is now <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kalendrole.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalendrole</a>. They would raid each otherâ€™s tribal coastal towns and war was very common.</p>
<p>Eventually, tribes grouped together through marriage or treaty and the tribal kings became Regional Kings. They had several towns and cities under them and ruled larger geographic areas. <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/masch.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Masch</a> became the most populous city in the area and the King of Masch ruled over the largest area but&nbsp;he didnâ€™t&nbsp;rule the entire country.&nbsp;<a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/king_orlan_baswerk.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Orlan Baswerk</a> was a regional king of an area known as the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/mellow_sea.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mellow Sea</a>.&nbsp;That area battled with the area known as the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kingsfire_barrens.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kingsfire Barrens</a> quite a bit and those wars continued up until about 150 years ago when all of Masch was united under a single monarch.&nbsp;There have been 7 kings since that time.&nbsp;<a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/queen_adele.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Queen Adele</a> is not mentioned in the book and neither was her brother <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/king_archman.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">King Archman</a> who was king for 12 years before she took the throne when he died.</p>
