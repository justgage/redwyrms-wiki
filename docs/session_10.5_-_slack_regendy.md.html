<p>The book on <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/the_dragonborn_scourge.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Dragonborn Scourge</a>‚Ä¶This book describes in detail an attack on the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kalendrole_capitol.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalendrole Capitol</a> by a pair of ancient white dragons. Their power was great and they killed almost 10% of the city population with their icy breath. They were finally driven off by a handful of great warriors but it created a lot of fear within the city that they might return. It also created a lot of anger and racism towards <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/dragonborn_people.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">dragonborn people</a>.
Several members of the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/velvet_sun.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Velvet Sun</a> and local dignitaries started drumming up hatred and anger towards the dragonborn. Especially the cold based dragonborn such as white and silver. They recruited an army and lead by a red tiefling named <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/dervin_eschondi.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dervin Eschondi</a> they entered into the Kalendrole woods to hunt down and slaughter the dragonborn.
The Velvet Sun seemed to rile up all the local tribes of non-dragonborns to help them hunt and kill the ‚Äúdangerous beasts‚Äù and destroy their cultures. The kings and chiefs of these tribes were fooled by the Velvet Sun to risk their lives to destroy a group of people who were not a threat.
Over a period of about ten years, all of the villages of dragonborn on the&nbsp; Kalendrole plains were wiped out. Most died fighting. Others fled deeper into the wilds. Others were dispersed and fled to cities far and wide.At the end of the destruction of the dragonborn culture, the people of Kalendrole finally realized how horrible it was and rebelled against the evil of the Velvet Sun and fought back.&nbsp;It was too late for the dragonborn and it created a lot of unrest in the City of Kalendrole.&nbsp;The city is not stable and power is divided between the guild and the dignitaries of the city and anyone who has the power to step up and gather others to their cause.</p>

<p>At the end of our last session, there were a couple days in game where you visited several cities returning orphans to their parents. There was a bit of downtime in those locations‚Ä¶ <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kalendrole.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kalendrole</a>, <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/masch.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Masch</a>, <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/eagle_bay.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eagle Bay</a>, <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/southeast.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southeast</a>.
If any of you want to do anything during that downtime in those locations, feel free to let me know. We can cover some things in Slack so we&nbsp;don‚Äôt&nbsp;spend much time in the beginning of the game covering details or shopping or research.</p>

<p>Thanks for the offer, Dan - it's been busy lately, but I've got some time. First off, Naefir is going to ask Azbara (or Gil) to identify the enchanted quill and paper he picked up from Deln's lair.</p>

<p>It is scroll making ink and paper.&nbsp;There is enough ink and paper to make scrolls for up to 14 levels of spells.&nbsp;Each level of spell takes abut 10 minutes of time to create the scrolls.</p>

<p>Hmm... Not seeing many great uses for scrolls as a druid, but that might be because I'm a newb. Anyone interested in making scrolls?</p>

<p>Druids (wizards, bards, and investigators as well) can make scrolls for any of their spells and then cast them later from the scroll without using a spell slot.</p>

<p>The nercomantic blood potion turns out to be a vampire healing potion. The two viscous potions are Inflict Wounds Grenade. You throw them at someone and if you succeed a ranged attack, the potions do 5d10 necrotic damage. The transmutation potion is a Potion of Haste.&nbsp;As per the 3rd level spell.</p>

<p><img src="https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f914@2x.png" alt=":thinking_face:">&nbsp;I'll think about the scrolls, but if anyone has any ideas, they're welcome to them. In the meantime, Naefir is going to use some of his free time showing Deln's Journal to Azbara Deln's Journal and asking what insights he might have. Specifically if he knows anything about the crown of High Tatra, why the diamonds were spread across all of Regendy, and why Deln and the Cult of Vecna would be interested in it. Also if Hextor's Hammer Crater has any connection to the crown or if that was an independent pursuit of Deln's. Naefir uses Find Memory and Guidance to help Azbara fill in any gaps and rolls a total of 19.</p>

<p>Spending some time with Azbara looking through books and historical scrolls you find the following:
In a book on the history of <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/gordon.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gordon</a>, you find some references to a now ruined city called <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/autour.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autour</a> near <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/gragor%E2%80%99s_bay.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gragor‚Äôs Bay</a>.&nbsp;Autour had an outpost called Gragor‚Äôs Outpost that was a tower overlooking the sea.&nbsp;In the great dragon battles of the past, good dragons would use the outpost to watch over the region.
A female dragon named <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/kelmarna,_the_golden_fire.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelmarna, the Golden Fire</a>, called heroes from the city to help her.&nbsp;They had stolen the <a href="https://justgage.github.io/redwyrms-wiki/crown_of_high_tatra.md" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crown of High Tatra</a> from the evil dragons and dismantled it.&nbsp;They wanted the heroes to take the diamonds and leave with them as quickly as possible scattering them to to four corners of the world.&nbsp;Numerous of these groups were chased down and killed by the evil dragons as they tried to get the diamonds back but several were successful and able to effectly hide the gems and keep the crown from being used to control good dragons.
This was about 1000 years ago.&nbsp;A single coin has survived from this original meeting of heroes.&nbsp;It is said that Kelmarna called the heroes together and they were each given a coin to show that they were trusted by the good dragons.</p>

<p>Hey I was thinking about it and we definitely need to take a detour to warn the forest gnome we met that Kaz imir might show up and they should get out of there temporarily. Also, do we have any ideas of a second task for Kaz imir?</p>
<p><img src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/T040QHMHTME-U040S21UE0G-0ea829da95ca-48" alt=""></p>

<p>Yeah, I've been thinking that, too. We also need a good plan on how we're going to handle Kaz Imir dropping off Dervin's body, assuming he succeeds. But Naefir would absolutely agree that we need to prepare the forest for a visit from Kaz Imir, assuming we still have time. Maybe Dan will let us go back and periodically keep an eye on the lair, though that would expend some more uses of Gileous and slow us down...</p>
<p>Yesterday</p>

<p>I have no problem with the idea that you visited the forest gnome. As a protector of the forest and his friends in the forest, the little gnome took it upon himself to warn everyone of the possible visit from Kaz Imir.</p>
<p><img src="https://ca.slack-edge.com/T040QHMHTME-U040S21UE0G-0ea829da95ca-48" alt=""></p>

<p>While we're there, Naefir grills him of the current situation in the forest - as a Firbolg, he's accustomed to the role of fey forest guardian. How many undead fey and dark and shazi-worm-infested creatures are roaming the forest? Are the trees healthy? Is it safe to wander at day and night? Are things getting better or worse?</p>
<p>Today</p>

<p>The forest gnome informs you that the forest has been very calm and quiet the past couple days (since you killed Deln) and the forest creatures are coming back out slowly and carefully.&nbsp;No undead have been spotted since his death and it feels as if a veil has been lifted.</p>
