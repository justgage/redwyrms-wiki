The myth appears to be that the crater was created by [[Hextor]].

[[Deln Eschondi's Journal]] makes an argument that it was actually created by [[Erythnul's Morning Star]].  This is consistent with Naefir's [[Verwood Forest Dreams]].  Deln also maps "HHC" on a bend of the river Nyasa in the [[Divided Desert]], not far from [[Bur-Aswan]].
