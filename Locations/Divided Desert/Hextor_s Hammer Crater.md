The myth appears to be that the crater was created by [[Hextor]].

[[Deln Eschondi's Journal]] makes an argument that it was actually created by [[Erythnul's Morning Star]].  This is consistent with Naefir's [[Verwood Forest Dreams]].  Deln also maps "HHC" on a bend of the river Nyasa in the [[Divided Desert]], not far from [[Bur-Aswan]]. 

Deln doesn't seem aware of it, but there was a mural in [[Deln Eschondi Lair]] (guarded by the spider dragon) that backed up his theory about the Hammer crater actually being created by Erythnul.  That painting also depicted a large iron man that everyone appeared to be fighting #unfinished
