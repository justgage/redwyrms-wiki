Major, ancient city in the Divided Desert - Coastal at delta of large river.  [[Deln Eschondi]], when questioned through speak to dead, indicated that "the children" are being trained here (in reference to what we believe is young tieflings, including [[Chaucerian]]'s daughter)

Very old, older than [[Gordon]], Major trading port for everything that doesn't grow in the desert, but also slaves.

Run by an emperor, which changes hands quite regularly.  The empire doesn't have a heavy hand, so it is very corrupt. 

[[Dervin Eschondi]] has a training facility in the outying islands.
