# Gragor Bay, Gordon
[[Diggs Hammerstein#World Map]] has a note in [[Gordon]] with the name [[Gragor]] and a bay of that name, including some references to dragons.  [[Deln Eschondi's Journal]] also expresses some interest in a few bays in the same region of Gordon, but he didn't seem certain of which bay it was.  He was particularly interested in the ruins of [[Autour]], which happen to be in the same bay that Hammerstein noted.

# Battle with the Dragons


Was Gragor a person whose name got attached to the bay?  Did he battle dragons? #what-does-that-mean
