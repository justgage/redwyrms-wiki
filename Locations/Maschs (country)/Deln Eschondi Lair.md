Located in a rocky bluff in the middle of the [[Verwood Forest]]
Doors are disguised, there's a trap in the entry area
Was visited by the [[Kazimer (the dracolich)]]
Appears to have been an ancient shrine to [[Boccob]] with a library, a reading room, and a room for the shrine keeper to live in. Deln has since repurposed these.
