The party was told by [[Durin McCormick]] that the Shazi worms invade your brain and control your actions, eventually devouring your brain and taking its place.

From [[-Monsters of the Divided Desert and the High Plateau-]]:
Known as the Aswanian Death worm because of its venomous bite. They can get big. Like 70’ long and burrow through the sand. No one knows what they eat but supposedly they grow huge after eating the souls of their victims.

The worms have a resilient body that is immune to bludgeoning démange but vulnerable to slashing damage. They live in the sandy regions of the desert. They come out at night and hunt from below. Most are only 6” to 3 feet long and eat rats and other small desert creatures. It doesn’t mention anything about them burrowing into people.
