# Next Session
On Slack:  Have Naefir ask the party about the dreams so he can write them in his notebook (while digging?).

1. See what Naefir can remember or read...
	1. about the helm and High Tatra
	3. about Who is [[Gragor]] and what was his battle with the dragons?  Connection with notes on map?
	4. about [[Hextor's Hammer Crater]]
3. **What time is it?**  Stop people from exploring more, take a rest!
4. **"What's the point?"** conversation.  What are we trying to accomplish?  What's with this crown? Shouldn't we be helping the creatures of the Verwood?
5. **Search for the shard** of Erythnul's morning star (and anything else magical)
6. **Clear out the library** - have a limited time in the crypt before someone comes for a wellness check, but need to wait for the dagger to recharge.  Convince Azbara to hold onto the books.
7. **What are we going to do with Flarina's corpse?** Find a safe resting place for the female red dragon, perform Gentle Repose.


# Eventually (Goals)
Investigate/identify the quill and paper (Can our Bard or Wizard do this as an L1 spell?)


# Notes to take
(Marked by #unfinished )

# Unknowns
(now tracked in situ as the following tags #what-does-that-mean )

Who is the [[Man in the White Mask]]?  Connection to [[Shazi worm]]s?

What is the [[dracolich]] up to?  How broad are his plans?  What are his connections with [[Deln Eschondi Lair]]?

What was behind the unnatural calm?

What does the [[female red dragon]] know?

Why was [[Diggs Hammerstein]] interested in [[Swanmaye Wyethander]]'s Kids?
