Blue Tiefling bard

Parents were killed by a sect of Tieflings, spent time with "uncle" (not sure if really uncle, may have been human). Later in life after met wife (human, cleric of [[Bahamut]]).  He had religious knowledge, but not necessarily religious and they bonded over this.  His wife was killed and daughter abducted. 
 Evidence seemed to show that it was also tiefling sect.  He is trying to find his daughter.  The only evidence that he could find was a map that referenced Ivy on the Mist

His daughter, [[Clarity]], is mostly human with some tiefling features (slight horns and a tail)

Dreamed of a Tiefling of red skin, with two daggers
