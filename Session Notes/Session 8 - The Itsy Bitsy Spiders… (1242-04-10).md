Session 8: The Itsy Bitsy Spiders… – Spring 1242 – First Year of the Reign of Queen Adele 

Kem cast Speak with Dead on the head of Deln [[Deln Eschondi]] before burying it. They place him in his coffin and Kem had an illusion place on him so that Deln would not recognize him. He asked where they were training the children and Deln responded,  “[[Bur-Aswan]].” Then the party finished the ritual to make sure the vampire never came back to life and buried him in the storage room. 

Naefir explored the lab some more and found a secret door leading to the north. He opened it but decided not to explore andy further until they had rested.

After a rest, they decided to open the door to the south and there they discovered a large room covered in spider webs. A large spider approached them but instead of attacking. It blocked the door. Soon they heard a voice that said, “My children… prepare to feast.” and the Spider Dragon attacked. 

A phase spider also appeared near the door to attack the party slipping in and out of phase to protect itself. The Spider Dragon breathed a breath weapon of tiny spiders. Naefir was able to use a spell Wither and Bloom to kill the thousands of tiny spiders that were covering everyone. The battle was intense and quick but the party managed to put down the Spider Dragon and her children even after she called upon her queen to help her.

The party explored the room. There was a mural on the south wall showing a battle scene.  [[Deln Eschondi Lair]]

The mural is beautifully painted and very old. On the left side of the wall, the giant figure is definitely [[Erythnul]] the god of slaughter also known as The Many.  He is in the form you have always seen him in - a beast and he is wielding his morning star.

On the right side of the mural, facing all of the armies of fiends, angels, and men is a huge iron giant. It looks kind of like a golem or something similar. It is the only other creature in the painting that is as big as Erythnul, and comparing it to the size of the people below, it would stand about 300' tall.  Naefir has some memories about such a creature but they are limited. He believes this might be one of the fabled [[Titans of Chaos]] who fought against the deities in an ancient battle. The Titans of Chaos were rumored to predate the deities but little is known of them. The name that comes to mind for this one is Father of Fire [[Father of Fire (Titan)]]. You believe that you have seen another name for him, but you can't recall it at this time.

Naefir also notices that there are several bodies on the ground in the mural. One is a young handsome warrior in golden platemail with a yellow cloak that is stained with blood. [[Erythnul]] is standing over his body. That warrior is wearing the symbol of [[Pelor]] engraved on his breastplate. It is not easy to make out at first because the details are pretty small but it is definitely there. The man is holding a dagger in each hand. Another young warrior is badly injured and he is stooping to take the daggers out of the dead warriors hands. He too is wearing a yellow cloak and though he looks young, there is a lot of pain and suffering drawn on his face. Another body lies on the ground near Etrythnul. It is an older wizard with long gray hair wearing purple robes ([[Boccob]] or one of his followers) covered in golden runes. His eyes are fixed on Erythnul and though he in prone on the ground his left hand is slightly raised as if he is casting a spell on Erythnul. The look on his face does not appear to be aggressive towards Erythnul. Naefir could stare that this painting for days.
