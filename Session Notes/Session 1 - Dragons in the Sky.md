Session 1: Dragons in the Sky – Spring 1242 – First Year of the Reign of Queen Adele 

  
  
 
Thorontor, Gil, Kem, Chaucerion, and Darkus were individually enjoying dinner at The Chisel[[the Chisel]], a beautiful tavern near the harbor in [[Ivy on the Mist]]Ivy on the Mist that serves decent food and bad ale. A gnome named Mickey Vonder is the owner of The Chisel and as a former woodworker he made the details of the tavern absolutely lovely. The tavern was crowded as there were rumors that a famous bard named [[Durin McCormick]]Durin McCormick was in town and going to play his lute and tell stories of the Monster Hunters at The Chisel.

  

Ivy on the Mist was filled with people. The weather the last few days had been unnaturally calm and the lack of winds were keeping any ships from leaving the harbor. A few ships had been able to limp into port, but no one was leaving. Also, up the road in [[Swan Field]], people were preparing for the annual Swan Festival where thousands of white swans land in the fields near the lake on their migration route. The festival would often draw in huge crowds with people celebrating great food, nice weather, good music, and the end of winter.

  

Durin, a dwarf dressed in fancy clothes and a large hat wide-brimmed hat with a colorful feather, entered the tavern accompanied by three other dwarves who looked to be adventurers and warriors. One of those dwarves was [[Diggs Hammerstein]] Diggs Hammerstein, the leader of the Monster Hunters. People were very excited about the music and seeing a group of celebrities.

  

Suddenly, a large crack of thunder startled the people in the tavern. It was unnatural as the weather did not show any signs of storms. People ran to the window to see what was going on. In the sky above the harbor were two huge dragons. One was a red dragon breathing fire and the other one appeared to be black with tattered wings [[Kazimer (the dracolich)]]. The second dragon was breathing a lightning breath. The two dragons were fighting each other. The [[Flarina, the female red dragon]] appeared to be chasing the other one and trying to bring it down. Neither dragon cared one bit of the collateral damage they were causing throughout the town. Lightning blasts were blasting ships and buildings and fire breath was lighting everything on fire.

  

The people came together to help. Magic rays of frost and bucket brigades putting out fires. The Chisel was hit with a direct blast of lightning that might have killed Gil if it hadn’t been for a well placed mattress and his quick reflexes. The dragons continued to battle in the streets and the Monster Hunters were moving through the city to try to get closer to the battle. Durin McCormick, the bard, was last seen heading south along the harbor away from danger.

  

The two dragons collided with a huge crash in the sky and fell towards the ground near the cemetery. Those who were brave enough made their way towards the cemetery to see what was going on and if they could help. As Chaucerian was heading towards the cemetery, a young boy ran out of a burning building carrying a small kitten. The boy was badly burned on his left arm and shoulder and part of his face. Chaucerian used one of his precious spell slots to heal the boy. Other brave souls reached the cemetery and witness the end of an epic battle between the two dragons as they fell to the ground. The red dragon’s neck was in the jaws of the other dragon and when they hit the ground hard, the red dragon disappeared. Gil, who was watching from the trees, noticed an unnaturally beautiful female elf on the ground under the black dragon who the party could tell was more of an undead corpse of a dragon than living flesh. 

  

Gil ran under the undead dragon and grabbed the unconscious elven lady and rolled into an empty grave. Diggs Hammerstein and his two dwarven warriors were attacking the undead dragon. Thorontor hit it with some magic missiles. Darkus created a fog to cover Gil and the elven lady and then he healed her to bring her back to consciousness. She immediately jumped back up and began fighting the undead dragon again. 

  

There was a burst of some sort of dark magical energy from the undead dragon. It didn’t hurt anyone but it caused the hair on the back of everyone’s neck to stand on end. Kem and Chaucerian were entering into the edge of the cemetery and they saw a skeletal hand reach up out of one of the graves. They attacked it and broke the hand and Kem threw himself bodily upon the grave to keep the skeleton from pushing up out of the ground.

  

The Monster Hunters were continuing to attack the undead dragon. Diggs ended up on its back attempting to hack it with his axe. His companions were along the side of the beast and having very little success doing any damage to it. The dragon blew the fog away with its wings. Diggs Hamerstein got bit in half. The elven lady was killed. The dwarves who were part of the Monster Hunters were blasted with lightning breath and one ended up in the river. The undead dragon then flew away.

  

Those that remained tried to wrap their heads around what had just happened. They searched the bodies of those that had been killed for clues (and loot). Diggs had a nice battle axe, a helmet that seemed magical, and a breast plate of armor. In his bag he also had a book titled Diggs Hammerstein’s Monster Manual that contained his notes and sketches of hundreds of monsters and beasts including many of his own notes and comments. In the books were two annotated maps, one of the region and one of the known world.

  

The groop also found two potions, a few coins, and some nice tall boots and red dragonscale armor on the elven lady. Darkus used his ability to not need air to search the river for the dwarven warrior and found him dead a little ways downstream.

  

As this group of survivors was trying to figure out what to do, they noticed that the ground around numerous of the graves was starting to tremble and move.
