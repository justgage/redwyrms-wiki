Session 5: Vampire Fey – Spring 1242 – First Year of the Reign of Queen Adele 

The party met back up with Kem as he was feeling better and there was a small gathering of townsfolk who had wandered out to the sage’s tower to see what had happened with the sea beast. As Chaucerion was telling a bit of the story and playing his lute, the party overheard a few people talking about pixies fleeing from the Verwood forest to the south of the lake. They also heard of a few hunters [[Hunters of Swan Field]] that were in the Verwood and one particularly who was late returning home.

The party went into the tower again with [[Azbara Vedos, Sage]] (the sage) and chatted with him abou what they found with Matrick [[Matrick Wallace]] in the small pond. He was amazed at the spear head. He knew it was [[Wyrmsbane]]… one of three identical spears that were used centuries ago to slay dragons. He told them that the spears were made by a copper dragon named [[Mordath]] who in his humanoid form was a dwarven blacksmith. He didn’t think Mordath was much of a spell caster so it must have been enchanted by someone else. 

Azbara helped as the party deciphered more of the writings on the map from [[Diggs Hammerstein]]. Filling in details where he could. They determined that the letter SW on the back of the amulet of Pelor could have been the initials of [[Swanmaye Wyethander]]. They heard about the wizard [[Deln Eschondi]] who they determined was the traitor mentioned in the letter from the King to Sir Gallion Curth. They found out the dagger was a parrying blade (+1 AC while wielding it). Kem got an identification scroll from Azbara as well as some nice inks to transcribe it. They found out their scrolls from Sir Gallion’s scroll case were Revivify and Remove Curse. Azbara temporarily enchanted Gil’s dagger to fight against undead (+1d6 radiant damage). 

Gil noticed a flying horse out the window of the tower. It turned out to be a small pony with a fey gnome riding on its back. They talked to the gnome and he mentioned a lot of strange undead in the [[Verwood Forest]] such as pixies and sprites and forest creatures. He was pretty upset about it all and not wanting any part of it.

The party decided to head to the Verwood to explore the happenings. They returned Matrick to his father in Swan Field and arrived near the Verwood close to dusk. The made camp instead of heading inside the forest and in the night 7 undead sprites approached the camp. The battle was on. One tiny undead fey attacked by polymorphing into a bear. Another into a giant snake. Another used the entangle spell and others turned invisible. The party fought hard and defeated the little beasts even after they seemed to be able to return from the “dead” and come back to life. Naefir decomposed them all and the party made sure they were all destroyed before going back to sleep for the night.

The party advanced to Level Three.
