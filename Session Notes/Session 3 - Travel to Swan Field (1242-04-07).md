Session 3: Travel to Swan Field – Spring 1242 – First Year of the Reign of Queen Adele 

Thorontor, Gil, Kem, Chaucerion, Darkus, Bob Smash, and Naefir questions Leah who had been attacked by undead and [[Shazi worm]]. She didn’t seem to know anything about it or have any reason why it would attack her. They returned to [[the Chisel]] for a good long rest.
  
Upon waking and eating breakfast, the tavern was packed and everyone was talking about the dragon attack and happenings at the cemetery. One man was boasting that he wished one of the dragons had fallen so he could have gotten rich from the teeth and bones. When questioned about it, he mentioned how “that Wallace boy” ([[Matrick Wallace]]) from [[Swan Field]] comes to town every fall with some dragon teeth and sells them for a fortune. 

[[Durin McCormick]] returned to the tavern and looked dejected. He said that “looters” had already gotten to the body of [[Diggs Hammerstein]]. At that point, Darkus decided to return the axe he had taken off Diggs to which Durin was pleased and whispered, “The Battle Axe of Dwarven Might!” 

The party talked with Durin and Mickey to find out what they should do next. They found out that [[Swanmaye Wyethander]] used to live in [[Watcher’s Point]] but had died recently. She was involved with both the cleansing of the undead in the region (along with a lady named Miranda) as well as had ties to [[Galleon Curth]] Sir Gallion Curth the dragon slayer. They also discovered that there was an old sage who had a tower up on the shores of Swanfield Lake. The party decided to travel to Swan Field.

Before they left town they checked in on Leah to make sure she was ok. She mentioned that she had a bad dream of a creature in a black cloak and featureless white mask with only eye holes [[Vincent Arcandor]]. It was watching her from a distance in her dream but didn’t do anything other than creep her out. He dream also had a bunch of bugs and worms. 

The road to Swanfield was fairly busy as many people were heading up to the Swan Festival. About half way to the town, the party came upon a small farmhouse that seemed suspicious. A small family cemetery up on the hill had some fresh dirt piles on the ground and the animals in the barnyard were moved as far from the house as possible. Gil was the first one to enter the farm house and saw an undead ghoul bent over something it was apparently eating. Gil ran to attack and stabbed it in the neck. The rest of the party soon joined in the battle except for Thorontor who was exploring the barn. There were two ghouls in the farm house and they had killed the two residents that lived here. Those two residents also then attacked the party as their corpses rose up to fight. Even after the ghouls were killed they seemed to be able to return to life and rise to fight again. They also attacked with a bite where their tongues would attempt to burrow into the flesh of their victims. They succeeded on this attack against Kem but he resisted the effect whatever it was.

Eventually the party defeated the ghouls and corpses and Naefir decomposed their bodies with a cantrip. The party searched the grounds and Kem found a small chest buried near the well that contained a little money and an ivory pendant.

The party continued to Swan Field and discovered there was a Wallace Inn. They went there and met with Matrick Wallace who was a young boy about 9 or 10 who sold the dragon’s teeth in Ivy on the Mist. He offered to show the party where the dragon bones were for 5 gold pieces as long as they agreed not to take any of the bones. They were set to leave in the morning.
