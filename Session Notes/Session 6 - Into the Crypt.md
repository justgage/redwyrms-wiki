Session 6: Into the Crypt – Spring 1242 – First Year of the Reign of Queen Adele 

Dreams: As the party slept near the edge of the [[Verwood Forest]], everyone experienced strange and vivid dreams ([[Verwood Forest Dreams]]). Dreams of a crown, tieflings with red skin, past trauma, poems of dragons, undead wizards, magic books, white masks, a magic dagger, and more. They discussed their dreams for quite some time and devised a plan (for Kem) to enter the forest and search for anything out of place. 

Kem opened his Grimoire to cast a spell and discovered an invocation to become One with Shadows. He had been warned by his father not to use the power which was gifted to him by the creature in the white mask [[Man in the Mask]]. He cast Locate Object to find the nearest Fey Home and led the party into the woods. They discovered a pile of rocks near a tiny stream and Naefir spoke with a small mouse-like creature to find out what was going on. The party discovered that undead were in the area and he was hiding.

The party continued on and found the half eaten body of one of the [[Hunters of Swan Field]]. There was also a trail of blood where a second body was dragged through the woods. Following the trail, they discovered the body of the second hunter as well as numerous bodies of pixies, and woodland creatures that were being loaded onto a small cart by a forest gnome. Upon speaking to the gnome, he was trying to remove the bodies so that they couldn’t be made into undead. The party helped him and made a friend. He told them about the doors and gestured towards a rock bluff. They couldn’t see any doors but discovered that there was an illusion hiding them. Gil picked the lock and they entered into a hallway. Kem searched for traps with Locate Object and found one straight ahead.  They discovered a room with a firebolt trap that Thorontor eliminated by casting Ray of Frost and Gil discovered a switch on the back side of the pillar.  As they opened the door on the left side of the room, they heard voices down the hall. Two people were discussing traveling to [[Masch]] and one of the voices (with a South-eastern [[Gordon]] accent) was not pleased to be working with the other person’s brother. As party members snuck down the hallway, they could see a tiefling with red skin speaking to a dagger. The man took the dagger and sliced through the fabric of space and slipped through out of the room.

The room was a laboratory. Books, chemistry sets, potions and lots of magical items filled the room. The party looted the room taking everything that was magical and lots of books as well. The party also found a bedroom with some wardrobes and a secret door that led to a natural tunnel. That tunnel led to a storage room as well as further down the hall towards a crypt with two beautiful coffins. One was a beautiful polished stone and the second was decorated with carvings of flowers, vines, and ferns. That coffin also had a plaque on it that read “My eternal love… [[Swanmaye Wyethander]]” and the coffin was empty.

The polished stone coffin was trapped but it was disarmed by Gil. Inside was a black silk lining with a small trail of dirt upon the silk. A longsword was inside the coffin and it looked that the coffin has been in use though no one was in it currently.

That was when the tiefling returned. Gil hid in shadows and Darkus wildshaped into a spider as the tiefling angrily went past into his coffin room. They ran back to the party and heard a glass crashing and voice from the tiefling say. “Find them and Kill them!” A deep gravelly voice replied… “Yes Master.” The party waited in the pillar room and saw an undead death knight approaching down the hall towards them.
