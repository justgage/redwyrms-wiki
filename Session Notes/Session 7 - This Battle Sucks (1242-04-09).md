Session 7: This Battle Sucks – Spring 1242 – First Year of the Reign of Queen Adele 

From Session 6…That was when the tiefling returned. [[Gil]] hid in shadows and [[Darkus]] wildshaped into a spider as the tiefling angrily went past into his coffin room. They ran back to the party and heard a glass crashing and voice from the tiefling say. “Find them and Kill them!” A deep gravelly voice replied… “Yes Master.” The party waited in the pillar room and saw an undead death knight approaching down the hall towards them. 

As the Death Knight walked down the hall towards the pillar room, the party prepared an ambush. No one knew where Darkus went. Gil climbed to the top of the pillar to attempt to sneak attack from above and while up there he placed the [[Crown of High Tatra]] on his head. There was a brief battle of wills between Gil and the crown but Gil was able to maintain control of it.

The Death Knight burst through the door and was ready to fight with a black spiritual blade in his hand. The party sprung the ambush on him and attacked. Naefir did devastating damage with his compost spell and the party did extremely well before the Death Knight even attacked. When Gil sprung from the pillar, he felt the crown’s power as dragon wings formed on his back to help him fly towards his target. During the battle, [[Deln Eschondi]] was seen watching from down the hall.

The Death Knight had some powerful strikes and was able to banish Thorontor to the Astral Sea, but it was no match for the onslaught from the party. It fell from a massive axe blow from Bob Smash and as it was falling its body simply dissipated into nothing. Thorontor returned when the Death KNight’s banishment ended and then immediately a necrotic fireball exploded in the middle of the room. Gil, Naefir, and Thorontor were knocked out and dying. Kem healed Naefir and then went to shut to the door to keep Deln out of the room.

Rufex eyed the crown on Gil’s unconscious head and took it for himself and placed it on his head. The crown had a powerful effect on Rufex and battled for control of his mind. 

A light grey mist flowed from under the door that Kem was holding shut and flew across the room. From the mist, Deln formed and began his attack against the party. Naefir cast blindness on him and it hindered him greatly in battle. Kem was grappled and bitten on the neck by Deln. The attack didn’t do a lot of damage but it did seem to suck the life energy out of Kem and restore lifeforce to Deln. The crown urged Rufex to attack the vampire. Kem revealed for the first time his angelic form and eyes reflecting the night sky and ethereal feathery wings formed up as battle Deln. Deln did not like the blood from the radiant soul and spat it out.

As the party finally defeated Deln, his body formed into a grey mist and floated through the door. Rufex and Gil had a battle over the crown as they were both being controlled by their desire to possess it. The party stepped in to stop the battle.   

The party realized that Deln might be returning to his coffin. They ran into the laboratory and found Darkus’ body on the floor with two small puncture wounds in his neck. They helped him and he was able to get up and go with the party though he was still very pale.

In the crypt, they found Deln’s body in the coffin. They drove a sharpened wooden javelin through his chest and discovered the magical dagger that Deln had used to travel. Chaucerion attempted to get the dagger to take him some place. It spoke to him in a Southern Gordon draw and he found out its name was [[Gillious, the Dagger]]. Gillious took some of the party to Ivy on the Mist to get some holy wafers and the body of Flaronia, [[Flarina, the female red dragon]]. They performed the ritual on Deln’s body by sticking the holy wafers in his mouth and cutting off his head and burying him with a grave marker.  

They also found a portal in the supply room and Thorontor activated it to reveal a prison on the other side. Gillious told the party that the portal went through to the dungeons of [[Castle Baswerk]].
