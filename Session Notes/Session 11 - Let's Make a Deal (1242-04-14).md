### Dan Ferris's Write-up
Session 11: Let’s Make a Deal – Spring 1242 – First Year of the Reign of Queen Adele (April 13-14)  

Gil bathed [[The Phase Blade]] in moonlight right before the full moon despite the sword’s desire to not be bathed in the moonlight.  As he does so he has an urge not to do so.  There was a strong feeling of being trapped and needing to be set free and if freed it will reward you if you don't bathe it.  The sword confirmed that it is the vestige of [[Lieutenant Kas]].  After it was bathed, the sword went silent.

The party also discussed what to do, should [[Kaz Imir]] say the first task was done and to ask for the second.  Options included asking for treasure, information, or taking care of [[Vincent Arcandor]]. The party decided to stall for more time and to get more information.

While the party was considering options, [[Chaucerian]] contacted Vincent Arcandor through the [[Crystal Ball]] to try to get some information about the [[Cult of Vecna]] and specifically about Kaz Imir.  He got some good information, but a whole lot more than he had expected. Vincent offered to make Chaucerion and any of his friends a warlock and grant them magical powers and abilities – even “ultimate power.”

Chaucerion negotiated a 14-day trial period where he could accept the warlock powers and in turn take care of a task for Arcandor. Arcandor laid out three options that he wanted done.

1.  [[Hadia Kima]] was searching for a powerful magic artifact ([[The Phase Blade]]) on the [[Gilli Plateau]] of the Divided Desert. Help her find the artifact. She is a Dark Paladin.
2.  Travel to the [[Goblin Wastes]] and find out what Vecna’s cultists are searching for in the ancient city of [[Meberaz]]. Arcandor had a guard there but he has seemed to have failed or gone rogue and Arcandor doesn’t know what is going on there anymore.    
3.  Find an ancient artifact - a crown that allows the wearer to manipulate the minds of dragons. Vecna is searching for it for some reason  ([[Crown of High Tatra]]).

Arcandor hates [[Vecna]] and wants him dead. He hates the cultists of Vecna and all of his servants. He spoke with venom about another lich named [[Acererak]] who serves Vecna. He said that  [[Kaz Imir|Kaz Imir]](Fulgurous) also serves Vecna after betraying his mother. He claimed he was not undead but that his soul was shattered by Vecna and now resides in the worms.  He also said that taking out Kaz Imir would be another task that he would reward. Chaucerian casually asked how they would destroy the phylactery of a lich and Arcandor said that he would take care of it if they brought it to him in Dasir

Chaucerion asked [[Gillious, the Dagger]] about Arcandor.   Gilious said Deln didn't like Arcandor at all and belittled him whenever he talked about him.  Talked about how Arcandor was meddling in Vecna's business. 

Chaucerion and Rufex both accepted the offer of warlock powers. The rest of the party declined (unless Thorontor or Bob Smash would like to accept). Naefir is wary of the warlocks in the party.

Gil received a message from Kaz Imir that the deed was done and [[Dervin Eschondi]]'s body was in front of the entrance to [[Deln Eschondi Lair|Deln's Crypt]].  The party used Gillious to go to Deln’s Crypt and found a red tiefling dead on the ground. His head was cut off. A stake was in his heart. Holy wafers were in his mouth. The body was badly mangled after a battle with the dracolich. However, when Kem cast speak with dead upon him, he said he didn’t know who Dervin was and didn’t know what Kem was talking about. At that point Kaz Imir dropped down from above to attack. He stated that Dervin told him where the phylactery was. Chaucerion started to pull out Gillious to make an escape and Kaz Imir noticed him. Then Gil put on the [[Crown of High Tatra]] and all of Kaz Imir’s attention was turned towards Gil, fixated.

Bob Smash stepped in front of the dracolich bravely and attacked with his great axe. But the dracolich didn't even seem to care as he jumped towards Gil with a single bite and claw multiattack that knocked him unconscious. Darkus was frightened by the presence of the dracolich and turned invisible. Just as Kaz Imir was about to bite Gil’s head off to get the crown, Naefir turned invisible and moved in to pick up his body. Chaucerion opened a portal with Gillious and people started going through, including Naefir with Gil. When Kem got through he healed Gil and Gil attempted to use the crown to control Kaz Imir who by this point had turned into a humanoid lich form and was about to enter the portal as he could see his phylactery. The crown summoned a bewildered unicorn, mastered Kaz Imir, and Gil forced him to turn around and transform back into a dragon and fly away. Gil also got a glimpse of Vecna’s [[Citadel of Cavitus]] as Vecna’s location.

Everyone went through the portal and Kem grabbed the phylactery that was still there. Obviously, Kaz Imir didn’t know where it was.

Rufex used his new warlock powers to create a minor illusion of a room deep under the ground in the [[dwarven mines of Karak, Gordon]]. Chaucerion used Gillious to open a portal to that location. They left the phylactery in the mine and collapsed the doorway leading into the room to make sure no one could get in. They then traveled to the Goblin Wastes using Gillious a third time to find out what Vecna’s cultists were up to.

They arrived outside a temple that was obviously altered by a beholder to be some sort of shrine to him. Naefir informed the group that [[Tares]] was a beholder and that Deln expected he had one of the diamonds for the crown of High Tatra. They entered into the temple and into a room with 11 statues in a circle around a pit in the floor. The statues were of a variety of different people in some odd poses. One was a winged angel person and Rufex accidentally knocked it over while examining the stonework. It shattered into hundreds of pieces. 

They heard some noises from the pit and discovered a dwarf from the Divided Desert was trying to climb back up the pit on a rope but only had one hand. Once they helped him up, he told the party that his name was Lazar and he was from a group called the Dungeon Guys from [[Bur Aswan]] who were escorting some wizards and others down into the city of Mebaraz below and that things took a turn for the worse. They were attacked by a beholder and his own hand had been disintegrated by a beholder eye ray. Others of the Dungeon Guys were killed and turned to dust. The group they were escorting was destroyed. He played dead for a while and then made his way quietly back out of the city.

The group asked if Lazar would lead them back into the city and he thought for a moment. Then Rufex offered him a red ruby that Arcandor had given him and Lazar agreed.

### Dan Christensen Notes
- Gil decides to bathe the Phase Blade in moonlight.  As he does so he has an urge not to do so.  There was a strong feeling of being trapped and needing to be set free and if it will reward you if you don't bathe it.  The sword confirmed that it is the vestige of Lt Kas.  After it was bathed, the feeling of Kas was recaptured and not aparent.
- Gil is contacted by [[Kaz Imir|Kaz Imir]] aying that his first task is done and asking for a second.  We went back in time and debated options of things to ask for
	- Treasure
	- Information
	- Ask for [[Vincent Arcandor]]'s phylactery (which Arcandor denies having one)
	- Ask Arcandor for more information on the [[Cult of Vecna]]
	- Fight Arcandor
- Chaucerion contacts [[Arcandor]] at twilight. It is dark. 
	- Arcandor promises many magical powers
	- He thinks Vecna has too much power - he gains power every day
	- Arcandor was killed by Vecna and shattered his soul and he's been recovering since.  It help him feel better.
	- Asked about Kaz Imir, he referred to him as Fulgurous.  Grand blue dragon that betrayed his mother and turned against his kind to serve Vecna.  He has influence over the cult.
	- Choices for first mission:
		- People whose mission aligns with his - [[Hadia Kima]] is a dark paladin, seeking an ancient artifact on Gilli Plateau.  Find her and help her find that artifact.
		- In the goblin wastes, multiple members of the cult have infiltrated Meberaz.  He wants to know what they are seeking out.  Arcandor's guard has been unable to stop them.
		- Vecna is also looking for an ancient artifact to manipulate the minds of dragons.  He wants us to bring him the magical crown for a large reward.
		- Take out Kaz Imir.
	- Vecna has a few liches that server him and Acererak and Kaz Imir, otherwise it is Vampires, and 
	- Asking generally about information about phylacteries he says to bring them to him in [[Dasir]] and he will help destroy them.
	- If we were to take this on, what would be the trial powers - pact magic to become a warlock with magic that would be nigh unstoppable, depending on how dedicated you are and your own experience with developing powers. (an extra level of Warlock)
	- Why is he stalking Kem - his angelic blood might give him a natural ability to fight against Vecna and a destiny to do great things
- Gilious said Deln didn't like Arcandor at all, but didn't respect him.  Talked about how Arcandor was meddeling in Vecna's business. 


- Kaz Imir brings Deln's body
- Kem uses Speak with dead and finds out that it is not Deln
- Kaz Imir appears and attacks
- Gil puts on the Crown and Kaz Imir majorly wants it - he attacks Gil and takes him down in one multi-attack.  
- Bob Smash axes Kaz Imir's mouth, but it doesn't stop him
- Naefir turns invisible and carries Gil through the portal
- Rufex attacks Kaz Imir with Wyrmsbane, but to little effect
- Thorontor and Kem also come through and Kem brings Gil back with 4 HP.
- Gil uses the Crown to dominate Kaz Imir, the Crown isn't great, but ok.  A full-size Unicorn appears and is confused.  He tells Kaz Imir to turn around and fly away. He feels hate
	- Where is Vecna - He sees a skull castle/city ([[Citadel of Cavitus]])
- The party is able to dive through the portal to the phylactery
- They quickly move the phylactery to the deepest point of the dwarven mines Rufex knows to be safe.  They cave in a doorway to cover the phylactery.
- After a short rest, they go to the Goblin Wastes to start on Arcandor's first task.
- They get to the entryway and investigate the statues.  Rufex rolled a double critical miss (with advantage) and as he was looking at the angel, he knocked the whole over and it shattered into pieces.  It didn't look like normal stone.
- They heard someone  trying to come up and discovered 
	- Whole party got wiped out . City is in ruins.  Ancient, not dusty.  Lake.  Giant rats & centipedes.  No goblins, only 5 miles away from the entrance.
